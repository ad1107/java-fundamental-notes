# Java Fundamental Notes
- My AP CSA exams is over so I decided to post my notes here for personal or (soon) public use.
- All the notes have been extracted from various books with no intention of imitating the quality.
- Not for use in standalone - but as a supplement or cram/revision for review, programming newbies or exams.


## Usage
- Best served in the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) note app.
- Put the folder inside your vault and open it like usual.
